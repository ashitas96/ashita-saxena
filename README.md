## Research Experience
**Modelling Gaze Behavior for Hallucination Detection** _(Jan 2023 - present)_

_[Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) & [Dr. Abhijit Mishra](https://abhijitmishra.github.io/)_
- Experimenting on hallucination detection in the context of pragmatic and reasoning instances
- Curated a dataset containing gaze annotations for 500 instances for the task of hallucination detection and developed a cognitively inspired BERT-based framework obtaining a balanced accuracy of 87.1%

**Hallucination Detection in Machine Generated Text** _(May 2022 - present)_

_[Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)_
- Developed novel strategies for synthetic data generation for phrase-level hallucination detection in abstractive summarization and proposed a RoBERTa-based model with a macro F1 score of 0.849
- Proposed a novel method using a RoBERTa model for fine-grained hallucination detection based on textual entailment outperforming the existing factuality inconsistency detection systems by 12%

## Projects
### DoodlerGAN: Exploring Adversarial Networks for Doodling
- Implemented a Generative Adversarial Network to create the next doodle stroke given a partial doodle
- Experimented on the Creative Birds Dataset obtaining 75% more diverse generations than the baseline

### Pianos are Hard? VAEs to the Rescue!
- Implemented a CNN based Variational Auto Encoder for generation of musical piano notes
- Used the Lakh Pianoroll Dataset for training by maximizing Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective

### Caption-consistency Detector
- Implemented an image caption consistency detector using a CNN and transformer-based architecture
- Conducted experiments on COCO dataset after negative-sampling and achieved an F1-score of 0.89
